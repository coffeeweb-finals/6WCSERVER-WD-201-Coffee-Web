# coffeeweb

/*
the group developed a web application named “Coffee Web” as it aims to promote the convenience of a cafe shop. Also, this application provides the menu and their information before going to the physical cafe. In simple explanation, the application provides service to the consumers, especially those who love to drink coffee, to book their reservation slot, and enjoy their cup of coffee while following the safety protocols.

  With that said, this group would be responsible for developing an effective website for our coffee shop. A website is simple to use, and online contact, particularly with customers, is available. Customers may explore our items before visiting the real shop, but they can also purchase through delivery, which is the website's main emphasis.

Customers may navigate the Coffee Web website using the Navigation bar which will direct them to different pages. First, the home page, which serves as the site's introduction. Second, the location of the real shop, as well as a sneak glimpse at the Coffee Web. The third page is the about page, which informs clients about the Coffee Web's goal and vision, as well as the owner's biography. Finally, the menu page is the website's focal point, where clients can find our products and make orders.
